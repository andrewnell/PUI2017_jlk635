## Assignment 1

Testing and assessing validity of the z-test. I generated 103 samples from the exponential distribution with parameter = 1/99 (i.e. mean = 99), and standard deviation equal to 99.

I calculated the mean of each sample and stored as distrMeans.

Calculate the z_statistic for each of the means, and show they follow a normal distribution with mean zero (0) and standard deviation one (1). 

Do all the plots and tests listed (clearly stating the null hypothesis and result in each case). For the tests I used alpha = 0.05.
