## Assignment 1

Using SKELETON WORKBOOK, read in data files

Plot scatter matrices. Reformat some values to float where needed

Transform to log-log model and plot line fits to both Units vs. Energy (Total Energy), and Energy vs. Units.

Calculate Poisson errors for the two fits. Calculate Chi-square statistics for the two fits and compare fits.

Fit a Quadratic model to the log-log initial plot, show predicted values and polynomial fit.

Calculate log-likelihood function for each of the two and compare the quadratic with it's nested linear model using likelihood ratio test.
