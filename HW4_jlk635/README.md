## Assignment 2


### I worked with Andrew Nell and Emily Hansen to review the following papers

  # FBB why did you look for a paper not on PLOS one? I specifically indicated to look for papers on plos one. the statistical significance you state for the Log Reg 0.05 I cannnot find in the paper. Plos One is rigorous about these things and would likely not acceot a paper that does not explicitly state the significance ahead of time
  
#   otherwise good


## Assignment 3

### I worked with Andrew Nell and Alex Ross to complete the hypothesis tests on difference in proportions and chi-square test for difference in factors



## Assignment 4

### I worked closely with Davey and Alex Ross to formulate the relevant datasets, and will undertake the relevant tests
