## Homework work balance

In submitting this homework, I worked on Assignments 1 and Assignment 3 on my own, with brief consultation with others as documented below.

For the citibike Assignment - I worked closely with Andrew Nell to develop our response.

I consulted other members of the class on ad hoc requests, e.g. how to plot the extra credit Gaussian. These people were Shrikanth, Davey and Imran.
