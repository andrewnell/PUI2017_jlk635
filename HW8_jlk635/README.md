# The Chernoff faces of CUSP 2017/18

The visualization I have chosen is a plot of Chernoff faces. I compiled a series of statistics by country for each of the countries represented by CUSP students in the 2017/18 class. The statistics were mainly urban in nature, and could relate to the overall economy, mobility, health, law and order. A summary of the data is provided in the data section later. The code is also provided for reference.
